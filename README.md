# secured-programming-education
This repository contains practical implementations of three classic and widely known cybersecurity attacks - SQL Injection, Buffer Overflow, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Its purpose is to help developers and programmers better understand these vulnerabilities in order to write more secure and robust software.

## Subprojects

### 1. SQL Injection
A hands-on environment demonstrating SQL injection attacks and techniques to exploit vulnerable web applications and databases. This sub-project uses Docker containers to simulate a web server and database for practice.

For details and analysis, see the [SQL Injection report](sql-injection/results/report.pdf).

### 2. Buffer Overflow
This sub-project explores buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs, including classical overflow attacks and Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). It contains exercises, shell code, and step-by-step solutions to understand exploitation and mitigation techniques.

For details and analysis, see the [Buffer Overflow report](buffer-overflow/report.pdf).

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Web Attack
Demonstrates XSS attacks and related web exploitation techniques such as Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI). Includes practical attack scripts and a vulnerable web app for hands-on experience.

For details and analysis, see the [XSS Web Attack report](xss-web-attack/results/report.pdf).
